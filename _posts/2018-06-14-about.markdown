Hi! I am an MLE/Economist at Uber where I work on causal ML in the context of multi-sided platforms. I received my PhD in Economics from Columbia University in May 2022. My primary research interests are in the fields of Urban Economics and Industrial Organization where I use both structural estimation and reduced form methods. 

Before Columbia, I completed my Masters from Delhi School of Economics in 2015. In my free time, I like playing chess and squash.
