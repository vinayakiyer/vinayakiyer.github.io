I received my PhD in Economics from Columbia University in May 2022. My primary research interests are in the fields of Urban Economics, Applied Micro and Industrial Organization where I use both structural estimation and reduced form methods. 

Before Columbia, I completed my Masters from Delhi School of Economics in 2015. Apart from research, I like playing chess and squash.
